# Meme Generator

This project is an interactive meme generator built with React, using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, allowing users to customize and generate memes. The application features background and border customization, enabling users to select from predefined background options and apply borders to the meme. Users can also edit the text on the meme, with options to adjust the font size for each line. As users make changes to the background, border, or text, the meme updates in real-time without requiring a refresh, offering a live preview.
